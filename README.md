# M&M (Math & Music) - Oscillart
M&M is a fun way to create your own music while simultaneously creating a visual representation of your music. Users can type in their own notes, create sine ways in different colors and adjust the volume to make the sine wave's altitude bigger or smaller. Users can also record and save their creation to their device. 

I made this project because creating and playing music is one of my interests and being able to combine computer science with music is something that caught my attention. Being able to follow the YSWS tutorial really helped in creating this project. One thing I struggled with was being able to center the buttons on the last step, but I learned a lot of new styling techniques in HTML and CSS.
